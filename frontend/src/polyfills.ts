// Minimal polyfills file so Angular build inside Docker finds the root file.
// Add required polyfills (for example `zone.js`) here if your app requires them.
// This placeholder exists because the Angular workspace references `src/polyfills.ts`.

/* Example import you can enable if your app needs it:
   import 'zone.js'; // Included with Angular CLI projects when required
*/

// Keep the file intentionally minimal — update with real polyfills as needed.
